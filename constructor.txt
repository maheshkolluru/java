constructor:
it is a special member in java,it looks like method but it is not beacuse it doesnot have a return type
constructor name should same has class name
constructor get executed automatically whenever object is created.
it calls default constructor if there is no constructor available in class. the default constructor is created by compiler


uses:
used for creating multiple objects
for intialisings non static varibales

Two types of constructor
user defined constructor:

the constructor which is created by the programmer
the user defined constructor can be parameterized and non parameterized
The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. 



parameterised constructor:
the constructor which is declared with parameters
the parameters are of any type,number and order inside the paranthesis of constructor
parameterised constructor can invoke when the object is created with same no of arguments.order of arguments and type of arguments

non parameterized:
the constructor which is declared without parameters
constructor get executed automatically whenever object is created without any arguments.

predefined constructor
 if there is no constructor created by programmer . the default constructor is created by compiler
predefined constructor is always non para



constructor overloading
declaring multiple no of constructor with same class name but different parameter list(no.type,order of parameters)
we use constructor overloading for creating same class objects in multiple ways


question
q.constructor cannot be a static
1.static is belongs to class rather than the object of class
so constructor get executed when object of class is created
2.if we create static constructor it cannnot be called from child class
beacause beacuse static allowed within the class

constructor is not final,abstract
