what is method?
method is a part of program which contains block in which we provide
a business logic to perform aa particular task.
It is used to achieve the reusability of code
The method is executed only when we call or invoke it from main method()
we  declare method inside the class or interface

method declaration

public       void           add             ()     {
(acess     (return type)   (method name) (parameters)
specifier)


method body
}


every method has method signature which is collection of method name and parameters

access specifier: who can access these method. it specifies the visibilty of the method
four access specifiers
public: it can be accessed by all the classes in application
private: it can be accessed by the class where it declared
private: it can be accessed by the all the classes of same package or subclasses in differnt package
default: whenever we not provided any access specifier it defaultly takes default specifier
which means it can access only in same pacakge itself.

return type:
return type is data type which we want to return from a method .return of primitive datatype,object,collection,void
usually if we dont return any thing it is void return type. 

method name:
It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method.
It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method
by using method name we will call the method or invoke it

paramters :
parameter should be separated by comma and should be enclosed in paranthesis
parameter consists of datatype and varibale name
if there is no parameters than paranathesis will be empty.



user defined methods are 
parameterized methods
non parameterized methods


parameterized methods
the method which contains parameters within paranthesis of method 
parameters can be any type
the paramter are used to recieve input to perform operation
we call parameterised methods by passing argument to the method name in main()
paramters get intialised when we call the method by providing arguments

non parameterised
method which is declared without any parameters inside paranthesis of method

static method
the method declared with static key word is know as static method
static method are called directly from main method with out creating object

nonstatic method/instance methods
the method declared without static key word is know as non-static method
we need to create object  of class and by using reference varabiles of object we need to call non static method.

two types of instance methods
accessor method or getter method()
which can be easily identified beacuse it is prsfixed with get key word it is also called getter method
it is used to get the value of private fields
mutator() or setter():
which can be easily identified beacuse it is prsfixed with set key word it is also called setter method
It is used to set the value of the private field.
